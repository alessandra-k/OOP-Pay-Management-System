# OOP Pay Management System

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Java to build a payroll system. The system calculates payments for various types of objects (invoices and programmers) in a polymorphic manner using interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance.

---

## Objective

1. Create a **hierarchy of programmer classes** using inheritance and polymorphism.
2. Use the `Payme` interface to standardize the calculation of payment amounts for all classes implementing the interface.
3. Process different objects **polymorphically** using a common interface and dynamically determine their payment amounts.
4. Demonstrate polymorphic behavior by processing both unrelated classes (`Invoice`) and related subclasses (`Programmer` hierarchy).

---

## Key Features

- Calculates payments for invoices and multiple types of programmers.
- Uses **dynamic method dispatch** to handle polymorphic behavior during runtime.
- Processes special cases, such as increasing the base salary of `BasePlusCommissionProgrammer` by 5% before payment calculation.
- Outputs detailed payment information for all objects.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Concepts**: Interfaces, Abstract Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- **Design Pattern**: Polymorphic Behavior Implementation
- **Testing**: Console-based output
- **Development Environment**: Eclipse

## Key Concepts

### Abstract Classes
- The `Programmer` class is abstract and provides common attributes such as name, social security number, and hire date.
- Contains an abstract method `getPaymentAmount()` that each subclass must override.

### Interfaces
- The `Payme` interface defines a contract for calculating payment amounts.
- Both `Invoice` (unrelated class) and `Programmer` (abstract superclass) implement `Payme`.

### Inheritance
- Subclasses (`SalariedProgrammer`, `HourlyProgrammer`, `CommissionProgrammer`, and `BasePlusCommissionProgrammer`) inherit from the `Programmer` class and override its methods to calculate payments.

### Polymorphism
- Objects of unrelated (`Invoice`) and related (`Programmer` subclasses) types are processed uniformly through the `Payme` interface.

### Encapsulation
- Each class uses private fields and public getters and setters to manage data, ensuring integrity.

## Dynamic Behavior

In the `PaymeInterfaceTest` class:
1. **Stores Objects**: An array of `Payme` references holds objects of both unrelated (`Invoice`) and related (`Programmer` subclasses) types.
2. **Iterates Over Array**: The program iterates through the array, dynamically calling the appropriate `getPaymentAmount()` method for each object.
3. **Special Case Handling**: If the object is a `BasePlusCommissionProgrammer`, the base salary is increased by 5%, and the updated payment amount is displayed.
